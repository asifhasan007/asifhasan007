Hi there, I'm an AI and Machine Learning Engineer! 👋
\nI'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about building intelligent, real-world applications. My focus is on backend development for enterprise-level AI systems, where I design and deploy scalable solutions.

🌱 I’m currently working on:

Developing an AI-powered Quiz Generator using Python, Flask, and various Large Language Models (LLMs), including local models and the ChatGPT API.

Enhancing BSmartPDF, a document interaction tool, by integrating local LLMs and adding multi-language support.

Building robust backend systems for document question-answering and other intelligent applications.

💻 My Tech Stack:

Languages: Python, SQL

Frameworks & Libraries: LangChain, Flask, PyTorch, Django

Tools & Platforms: Docker, PostgreSQL, Git

AI/ML: Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🔭 My Interests:

Applying deep learning techniques to practical problems in computer vision and NLP.

Exploring the capabilities of both API-based and local LLMs to create innovative applications.

Building full-stack projects that bridge the gap between powerful backend systems and interactive user experiences.
